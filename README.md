# Optimal-Power-Flow-Solver


### Introduction 
An Optimal Power Flow solver, using a PSO (particle swarm optimization) variant to perform OPF on an n-bus power system.

### Inspiration
PSO is a leading metaheuristic, and I wanted to develop my own variant based on research conducted, to perform OPF, which is a highly non-linear, constrained problem.

### Technologies
Python, PyPower, NumPy, MatPlotLib
